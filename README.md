## Project Ideas

1. *Converse2Canvas*
	Course details in Canvas very useful. But it is not automated. Our idea is to automate common tasks across the courses while enabling students to ask information and request to do tasks. For example asking the Canvas to submit honesty pledge, reminding to-do tasks.

2. *Automated RideShare*
Idea is to connect drivers and riders automatically based on the routes and starting location. We will also predict the volume of people commuting and alert transport services or potential drivers to serve the riders.

Professor Ranjan's Idea

3. WeServe: Connecting  pro-bono and student volunteers to the NGOs around the world.
	When NGOs start a social project they usually do not have resources to apply technology platform and best practices. So they often  start with manual work and paper based system to collect  data and make decisions. They need help with things other than technology such as consulting, efficiency and applying proven techniques. This platform connects pro-bono consultants and students (high  school and college) volunteers to the NGOs. 
NGO posts the project. Students and pro  bono consultants creates their profile, interests and expertise and timeline they might be available to work/help. System applies intelligent algorithm to match them.
