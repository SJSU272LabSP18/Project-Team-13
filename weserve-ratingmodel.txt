Users types- volunteers, pro-bono consultant, ngo
Our model creates project ratings for each user
These ratings are fed into ElasticSearch and Spark ML Libraries, with the Alternating Least Square algorithm. 
We are recommending based on user-project ratings matrix.
The rating system is not visible to users of any type. 
The ratings are generated automatically behind the scenes, specifically for this ML engine.
